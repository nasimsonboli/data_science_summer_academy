# [DATA SCIENCE SUMMER ACADEMY](https://ddssacademy.wordpress.com/)

The Data Science Summer Academy is an intensive week-long program to introduce high school students to the fast-growing field of data science.  Students explore ways to analyze data, and learn how to create innovative solutions using digital information to make a positive impact in our society. The program was held at DePaul University’s Loop campus from 9:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. on June 25th-29th, 2018.

Participants engage in hands-on activities taught in a computer lab setting and are taught by full-time DePaul faculty members with real-world experience. Students use the latest computer applications to build visualizations, to analyze and extract information from data. Projects are drawn from real-life applications around topics that are of interests to the students.

The Academy provides students with valuable educational experience and an advantage in today’s competitive world of college admission.
